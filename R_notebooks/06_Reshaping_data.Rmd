## Outline

-   Converting to/from tidy format

## Introduction

There are often cases where you'd like to change the shape of your data, by
which we mean to change the structure of the columns and/or rows. The `tidyr`
package contains functions to support this.

As an example dataset for reshaping, we'll use data on territorial fossil CO2
emissions by country (Friedlingstein et al. 2023)[^1].

**Note:** To read the data, we'll use a call to the `read_excel` function from
the `readxl` package. We only touched on this in notebook 2, so don't worry
about understanding exactly how the data is read in. Treat this as a glimpse of
seeing the Tidyverse in action 'in the wild'. You can read up about `read_excel`
as extra homework, if you're keen :-)

```{r}
emissions <- readxl::read_excel("data/National_Fossil_Carbon_Emissions_2023v1.0.xlsx",
                          sheet = "Territorial Emissions",
                          skip = 11) |>
  dplyr::rename(Year = `...1`) |>  # missing column name in data got assigned name `...1` when reading
  dplyr::select(Year, World, Africa, Asia, `Central America`, Europe,
                `Middle East`, `North America`, Oceania, `South America`,
                Bunkers) |>
  dplyr::mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))

print(emissions)
```

## Converting to/from tidy format

One scenario for reshaping data is when we receive data that is not in tidy
format and want to transform it so that it is tidy.

In the emissions data above, notice how each column other than 'Year'
corresponds to a region of the world (or the category 'Bunkers'):

```{r}
colnames(emissions)
```

This is not in tidy format. The observations correspond to year-region pairs,
while the variable being measured is territorial emissions. But the data is
structured as a matrix, where to get the emissions value for a region and year
you look up the entry for the appropriate row and column.

What we'd like to do is create a dataframe with columns 'Year', 'Country' and
'Territorial_emissions' columns, with rows corresponding to year-region pairs.

### Matrix format to tidy format with `pivot_longer`

We can use the function `pivot_longer` from the `tidyr` package to help us make
the required transformation. Like most of the Tidyverse functions, there are a
lot of possible parameters to use in this function, but we only need to use it
as follows:

```         
tidyr::pivot_longer(data, <columns-to-gather>, names_to = "Name_for_gathered_columns", values_to = "Variable_name")
```

where

-   `data` is the dataframe to transform.
-   `<columns-to-gather>` is a specification of the columns that should be
    gathered into a new column.
-   `names_to` defines the name of the new column to create, whose values will
    be the names in `<columns-to-tidy>`.
-   `values_to` is the name of a new column that contains the values that were
    in the columns `<columns-to-gather>` (i.e. the variable that the original
    data was giving).

**Note**: More specifically, `<columns-to-gather>` is a 'tidy-select'. This is a
way of specifying collections of columns within the Tidyverse. Unfortunately
details of this are outside the scope of this course, but you can learn more by
running `?tidyr::tidyr_tidy_select` in the R console. We will explain our use of
'tidy-select' in code comments below.

The behaviour of `pivot_longer` is much easier to see with an example. The
following creates a new column called 'Region' that contains all the column
names in `emissions` from 'World' to 'Bunkers'. The values from these columns
are put into a new column called 'Territorial_emissions'.

```{r}
emissions_tidy <- emissions |>
  tidyr::pivot_longer(World:Bunkers,  # All columns from 'World' to 'Bunkers'
                      names_to = "Region",
                      values_to = "Territorial_emissions")

print(emissions_tidy)
```

Notice how each row corresponds to a year-region pair. The
'Territorial_emissions' values line up with the year and region they
corresponded to in the original data.

Notice that the number of rows is equal to the number of regions multiplied by
the number of years, as we'd expect:

```{r}
cat("Number of rows in emissions_tidy:", nrow(emissions_tidy), "\n")

# Use ncol(emissions) - 1 so not to include the year column
cat("Number of year-region pairs:", length(emissions$Year) * (ncol(emissions) - 1), "\n")
```

In general, `pivot_longer` is called such because it make the table of data
'longer' i.e. have more rows.

#### Exercise: pivoting

What do you think the output of the following `pivot_longer` will be?

```         
emissions |>
  tidyr::pivot_longer(!Africa,  # this means all columns except 'Africa'
                      names_to = "Names_column",
                      values_to = "Territorial_emissions?")
```

Run the code below to see if you're correct!

```{r}
emissions |>
  tidyr::pivot_longer(!Africa,  # this means all columns except 'Africa'
                      names_to = "Names_column",
                      values_to = "Territorial_emissions?")
```

What do values in the 'Africa' and 'Territorial_emissions?' columns correspond
to in the following output?

```{r}
emissions |>
  tidyr::pivot_longer(!Africa,  # this means all columns except 'Africa'
                      names_to = "Names_column",
                      values_to = "Territorial_emissions?") |>
  dplyr::filter(Names_column == "Year")
```

### Tidy format to matrix format with `pivot_wider`

What if we want to go the other way, i.e. turn a tidy dataframe into a matrix
format? In that case, we can use `pivot_wider` from the `tidyr` package.

```         
tidyr::pivot_wider(data, names_from = <column-to-make-new-columns-from>, values_from = <column-of-variable>)
```

where

-   `data` is the dataframe to transform.
-   `names_from` is the column whose values will be the names of new columns in
    the new dataframe.
-   `values_from` is the name of a column whose values will go into the 'cells'
    of the new dataframe.

To see this in action, the following use of `pivot_wider` will take our tidied
emissions data and put it back into the original 'matrix' format, where regions
corresponded to columns and the entries gave the emissions for each year-region
combination.

```{r}
emissions_tidy |>
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = Region, values_from = Territorial_emissions)
```
