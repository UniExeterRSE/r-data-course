## Introduction

In this notebook we'll be looking at ways to work with two common kinds of
data: text data and dates/timestamps. When we first create and collect data, it
may not be in its cleanest form, especially when it comes to working with
text data and timestamps. The following packages provide lots of useful
functions for working with strings / timestamps:

- `stringr`: working with strings (included with `tidyverse`).
- `lubridate`: working with dates/timestamps (a non-core Tidyverse package).

To demonstrate these packages, we'll be working with two datasets:

- A toy dataset consisting of some coin flipping experiments (thrilling stuff).
- Weather data from the Palmer Station in Antarctica from 1989 - 2019, where
  data are available for each day[^1].

**Note** We'll be making use of the pipe operator `|>` throughout; see
the `04_Piping.Rmd` notebook.


## Working with text - heads and tails

We have a toy dataset for getting familiar with working with text. The
`heads_and_tails.csv` file contains data on some coin flipping experiments
performed by two people, Joe Bloggs and Jane Doe. The experiments were performed
on different days and are split up into different parts (coin flipping is
tiring work).

The data is not in a clean state:
- Joe and Jane's names are recorded in multiple ways.
- The results are inconsistently formatted.
- The experiments look pretty consistent, but note that in some rows the date is
  separated from the `part n` bit by a colon `:` whereas in other rows it's
  separated by a space.

```{r}
# Note: reading all columns as strings

```

We'll use some of the functions in `stringr` to clean up this dataset.


### Cleaning whitespace

Before tidying up the columns, let's first rename the current columns to indicate
they contain the 'raw' values. We can use the function `rename` from the `dplyr`
package to do this:

```{r}
# Rename columns to *_raw

```

Let's first tackle cleaning up the technician's names. Look at the unique values
in the 'Technician_raw' column:

```{r}

```

Let's make the case consistent. There are several `stringr` functions we could
use for this, of the form `str_to_*`

```{r}
name <- "aLbErt EinStEin"
  # lower case
  # upper case
  # title case
  # sentence case
```
Let's convert the technicians' names to title case. Do we now have consistent
names for Joe and Jane?

```{r}

```

Not quite. We can replace the two spaces in the middle of "Joe  Bloggs" with a
single space by using `stringr::str_squish`:

```{r}
# Remove repeated whitespace characters

```

Note that a closely related `stringr` function, `str_trim`, can be used for only
removing leading and trailing whitespace, if for some reason we wanted to keep
all the whitespace between the words:

```{r}
# \t = tab character, \n = new line character
name <- "\tAda    Lovelace  \n"

```


### Replacing characters / substrings

Next, let's make the 'Result' entries consistently formatted. We'll remove
the commas from the first few experiments and instead just have a string of
`H`s and `T`s. We can view this as replacing each comma with the empty string,
`""`. 

In general, to perform text replacement, we can use one of the following
`stringr` functions:

```{r}
vowels = "a--e--i--o--u"

# Replace the *first* instance of "--" with ", "


# Replace *all* instances of "--" with  ", "

```

You may wonder why the parameter name 'pattern' is used for the string we want
to replace. The reason is that we actually need to supply a *regular expression*
to match on. We'll come back to this.

Let's now clean up the 'Result' column by removing the commas:

```{r}
# Remove commas i.e. replace with empty string

```


### Exercise: replacing strings

Put the 'Experiment' column into a consistent format, so that the experiment is
recorded as "<date>:part <n>" where "<date>" is a date string and "<n>" is a
number 1, 2, etc.

```{r}

```


### Splitting and concatenating columns

With the columns cleaned up, we no longer need the 'raw' columns, so let's
remove them:

```{r}

```

It would be good to have the 'Experiment' column consist of a unique identifier
for each experiment. We could just give it an integer label, but let's do
something more sophisticated. Each row is uniquely identifiable from the
current 'Experiment' string and the name of the Technician. So let's combine
these together to make a new ID string, as follows:

```
Joe Bloggs  +  2024-01-04:part 2  -->  2024-01-04:2:JoeBloggs
```

Note that we've removed the "part " string and removed the inner space in the
name. How can we accomplish this transformation in smaller steps?

- First split the experiment label "2024-01-04:part 2" into two pieces:
  "2024-01-04" and "2".
  
- Remove the space from the name, "Joe Bloggs" to "JoeBloggs".

- Paste the results together using colons:
  "2024-01-04" + "2" + "JoeBloggs" --> "2024-01-04:2:JoeBloggs".

We know how to do the second step (use `str_replace`), but steps 1 and 3 are new.

The trick is to do this column-wise in the dataframe. Se we'll
**make new columns** containing the pieces we want to paste together, and then
create a new column by pasting these two columns together.

To perform the splitting, we can use the `separate` function from the
`tidyr` package (not `stringr`!) to split a column on a separator. The result is
one column for each piece of the split; we thus need to also provide names for
the new columns:

```
tidyr::separate(data,
                col,
                into = c("NewCol1", "NewCol2", ...),
                sep = <string_to_split_on>)
```

To paste columns back together with a custom separator, we can use the
`str_c` function from `stringr`:

```{r}

```


### Exercise: splitting and concatenating columns

Use `tidyr::separate` and `stringr::str_c` to create a unique experiment ID by
pasting together:

- The experiment date
- The sub-experiment number
- The technician's name (without a space)

E.g.
```
Joe Bloggs  +  2024-01-04:part 2  -->  2024-01-04:2:JoeBloggs
```

Hint: don't try to do this all in one go. Instead, build it up step-by-step and
use the pipe operator `|>` join the steps together.

```{r}

```


### Finding substrings

How many of the experiments features a run of 5 heads or 5 tails?

We can answer this as follows:
- For each row, determine whether it contains a run of 5 heads or 5 tails.
- Filter on the result.

To perform the first step, we can use `str_detect` from `stringr`. This simply
returns `TRUE` or `FALSE` depending on whether it finds a given pattern in
a string:

```
stringr::str_detect(a_string, pattern)
```

The `pattern` argument is interpreted as a _regular expression_. We mentioned
this earlier when looking at `str_replace` / `str_replace_all`. Regular expressions
are a mini-language for specifying matches on strings. We're not going to go into
this much here, but they are useful to know about, especially if you work with
text data a lot; check out the great
[stringr cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/strings.pdf)
for a summary, or consult the
[chapter on regular expressions in R for Data Science (2e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/regexps)
for an introduction. Here are some example regular expressions in action, using
`str_detect` to indicate whether the given string matches or not:

```{r}
# Match on a string as-is (case sensitive)
stringr::str_detect("Regex is cool.", pattern = "ex") |> print()  # true
stringr::str_detect("Regex is cool.", pattern = "COOL") |> print()  # false

# Match on 1 or more instances
stringr::str_detect("Regex is cool.", pattern = "o+") |> print()  # true
stringr::str_detect("Regex is cool.", pattern = "coolcool+") |> print()  # false

# Regex-special characters need escaping e.g. to match on a period, use \\
stringr::str_detect("Regex is cool.", pattern = "\\.") |> print()  # true

# Match on either one pattern or another with pipe |
stringr::str_detect("Regex is cool.", pattern = "cool|meh") |> print()  # true
stringr::str_detect("Regex is meh.", pattern = "cool|meh") |> print()  # true
stringr::str_detect("Regex is cool.", pattern = "meh|lame") |> print()  # false

# Match at the beginning of the string only with ^
stringr::str_detect("Regex is cool.", pattern = "^Regex") |> print()  # true
stringr::str_detect("Regex is cool.", pattern = "^cool") |> print()  # false
```


### Exercise: finding substrings

With the help of `str_detect` and a suitable regular expression, write code to
work out how many experiments feature a run of at least 5 straight heads or 5
straight tails.

```{r}

```

## Working with dates

We have weather data from the Palmer Station in Antarctica from 1989 - 2019[^1],
where data are available for each day.

```{r}
weather <- read.csv("./data/PalmerStation_Daily_Weather.csv")  # using base R read.csv here!
str(weather)
```

However, the structure of the data above indicates that the first variable 'Date'
is a 'character'. This means that R is not understanding these as representing
dates, and so it may be hard to manipulate them any further (e.g. extracting
certain years).

```{r}

```

(**Note**: if we'd used `read_csv` from the `readr` package then these would
automatically have been coerced into dates. We're avoiding this for now to
demonstrate how to convert raw strings into dates.)

We'll use the `lubridate` package (loaded in when we load in `tidyverse`)
to convert these variables into dates and create a column for the year.


### Converting from strings

The `lubridate` package has very intuitive function names and argument
structures. For instance, you can convert a string into a date type by
using a function with letters representing the date format. In `lubridate`,
y = year, m = month, d = day, h = hour, m = minute, s = second, etc.

(You can see all of these formats by using the auto-complete box in RStudio,
e.g. to see all functions starting with 'y', begin typing `lubridate::y`.)

We can see that our data is formatted in the year-month-day format, and so we
can use the `ymd` function to indicate to R what format we want it to detect as
it converts characters to dates. If we use this function and assign the output
to a date vector, we can then evaluate the class to see that it is a date.  

```{r}

```

Remember that manipulating a column does not mean it automatically saves into
the dataframe. Instead, we need to explicitly overwrite our dataframe with a
new dataframe that contains the modified column. We can use the mutate function
to achieve this:

```{r}
# Change the Date column to be a date type

```


### Accessing timestamp components

Now that R recognizes these as dates, we can extract certain date-related
features, such as the year, month, and day. The `lubridate` package has functions
conveniently named `year`, `month`, `day` that can be used with a date argument,
and that element of the date will be extracted. For example:

```{r}
# Extract the year

```


#### Exercise: working with dates  

Create a summary of the weather data that gives the maximum, minimum, and
mean of the average temperatures for each **month** of the year.

```{r}

```
