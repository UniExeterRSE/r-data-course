## Review

This course has provided an introduction to working with data using packages
in the Tidyverse. We looked at

- Using `readr` to reading csv data with explicit column specifications, and
  touched on other packages for reading other kinds of files e.g. Excel
  workbooks.
- Using `dplyr` to manipulate data (selecting columns, filtering, summarising,
  sorting, etc.) and for joining multiple dataframes together.
- Using `tidyr` to reshape data e.g. from 'matrix' format to tidy format.
- Working with strings and dates using the `stringr` and `lubridate` packages.

We also discussed some key philosophical underpinnings of the Tidyverse:

- Adopting the convention of putting data into _tidy_ format.
- The idea that the functions in Tidyverse packages are designed with very
  consistent 'interfaces' e.g. taking in a dataframe and returning a new
  dataframe.
- The 'functional' style of programming, where we can set up pipelines for
  performing successive transformations of data.


## Next steps / further resources

This course has given you a grounding in using the Tidyverse and you
now feel confident using it in your own work. To take your knowledge further,
the following extra resources are available:

- Cheatsheets for several Tidyverse packages, including the ones we've covered
  in this course, are available at <https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/>.
  These are a great way to quickly look up function(s) that help you perform
  some concrete task. Often it's a good idea to look at the cheatsheet to know
  what functions(s) you need, then use the help system in R to read the
  documentation, or search the web for further advice.

- The [R for Data Science book (2nd ed.)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley
  Wickham, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel and Garrett Grolemund is a freely available,
  online book which covers lots of aspects of working with and visualising data
  using the Tidyverse in a way that's approachable for non-expert R programmers.

- A natural follow up to this course would be to learn about plotting and
  visualising data in R with the `ggplot2` package, which is part of the
  Tidyverse. The R for Data Science book above is a great resource to start
  with for learning how to plot with `ggplot2`.
