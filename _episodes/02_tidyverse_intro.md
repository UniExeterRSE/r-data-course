## What is the Tidyverse?

The Tidyverse is self-described as:

> "...an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All
> packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures'."
>
> â€” <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">https://www.tidyverse.org/</a>

When you install the `tidyverse` package, you install a suite of 9 tidy-related
packages, all of which are designed to help you work with data, from cleaning
and manipulation to plotting and modelling. They are increasingly popular,
have large user bases, and are generally very well-documented.
