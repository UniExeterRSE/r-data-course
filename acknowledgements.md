The course material is adapted from Eliza Wood's

course, which is licensed under

This in itself is based on material from <a href="https://gge-ucd.github.io/R-DAVIS/index.html" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">UC Davis's R-DAVIS course</a>,
which draws heavily on <a href="https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">Carpentries</a> R lessons.
