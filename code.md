NOTE TO DEVELOPERS
------------------

WHEN THIS COURSE IS SUPPORTED BY VOLUNTEERS WHO ARE LENDING TIME OUTSIDE THEIR
OFFICIAL DUTIES, THE FOLLOWING CODE OF CONDUCT IS MORE APPROPRIATE:

These courses have been developed by a team of volunteers and are under
continual review to ensure that they are fit for purpose. The delivery of these
workshops is often performed at the margins of an individual's official job
description, so please be considerate of this when communicating with the workshop
leaders and helpers.

Our ethos is to provide a welcoming and supportive environment for all people,
regardless of background or identity. By registering to attend one of these workshops,
participants are agreeing to abide by the Researcher Development
<a href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/doctoralcollege/researcherdevelopment/images/Code_of_conduct.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer" download="">Code of Conduct</a>.

Our goal is to support you to develop your programming skill sets to enable you
to do cutting edge research. We want to create a positive and professional
learning environment and therefore encourage the following kinds of behaviours:

- Show courtesy and respect towards all who attend a workshop or engage in
  community events.
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism.
- Be patient if there are technical glitches. While we know something about how
  to use computers we are not immune to internet or hardware issues.

Thank you for taking the time to read our Code of Conduct. We look forward to
welcoming you on to our courses.
