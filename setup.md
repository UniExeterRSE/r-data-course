In order to fully participate in this course, you should make sure you
have the following in place **before** the first workshop.

- Install R, version 4.1 or later. You can download this from the University's
  Company Portal software repository. Alternatively, visit
  <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">https://cran.rstudio.com</a>,
  or adopt whatever method you usually use.
  
- Install RStudio desktop. You can download this from the University's
  Company Portal software repository. Alternatively, visit
  <a href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/</a>.
  We will use RStudio to work with R notebooks throughout the course. If you have
  another way of working with R notebooks that you prefer, then you are welcome
  to use this, but we recommend using RStudio if you're unsure.

- Ensure you have following R packages installed:
  - `tidyverse`
  - `palmerpenguins` (This contains a dataset we'll use in examples during the
    course.)
  
  Note: if you use a package management system, such as
  <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">renv</a>,
  then you may want to create a project-specific environment for the course
  materials.

- Download the course materials. These will be made available from this page
  by Monday 11 March 2024 at the latest.
